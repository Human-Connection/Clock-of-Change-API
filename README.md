# Clock of Change - API Server (Backend)


This repository contains the API Server - or in other terms Backend - of the Clock of Change.

To find out more about the Clock of Change and Human Connection - the network behind it - visit https://human-connection.org/en/.

## Tech Stack

* Node.js: The API Server is running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a JavaScript runtime environment for server-side scripting
* Express.js: We use the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/) framework - a Node.js framework to help build web applications
* Nodemon: We use [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for development - a handy replacement wrapper for Node.js that automatically restarts the application on file changes
* MySQL: We use [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) as our relational database of choice to store our data 

the new COC API is written in nodejs on top of express. 
All routes reside in /core/restapi.js

## Project Structure & Components

**PROJECT STRUCTURE / DIRECTORIES**

* server.js: The starting point for this Node.js application which starts the server
* core/: The core directory contains the most important files of the project like database, mailer, router and main controller
* core/entryController.js: Is the main controller for all the requests
* core/restapi.js: All routes can be found here, they will also be listed further down
* mails/: The mails directory holds the mail templates
* public/: The public directory is not used for now


**DATABASE**

We use MySQL for the COC API as our relational database. 
Currently all of the database related code can be found in the `core/db.js` file.
This includes the credentials for the database (host, user, password and db name) and can be changed in this file.

and right now we have 2 tables entries and apikeys

**MAILER**

The code related to the mail system can be found in the file `core/mailer.js`.
For the mailer to work the smtp credentials need to be changed in this file as well.
Then the mailer will work and use the mail templates from `mails/entry/`


## Installation

**PREREQUESITES**

Before starting the installation you need to make sure you have the following tools installed:
* Git: You need to have Git installed. You can check this in the console with `git --help`. For installation instructions visit https://git-scm.com/
* Node.js: You need to have Node.js installed. You can check this in the console with `node -v`. For installation instructions visit https://nodejs.org/en/
* Npm: You need to have npm installed. You can check this in the console with `npm -v`. For installation instructions head to https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

**INSTALLATION**

1. First you need to clone the git repository of the Clock of Change API. Head to a directory where you want the git repository to reside
and open the directory in the console. Then run `git clone https://github.com/Human-Connection/Clock-of-Change-API.git` to clone the repository to this directory.
2. Go to the newly created Clock-of-Change-API directory (`cd Clock-of-Change-API` in the console) and run `npm install`.
Now all the dependencies should install.
3. Edit the file `core/db.js` and add your MySQL credentials (host, user, password, database name). 
4. Create the tables - ADD LATER
5. Edit the file `core/mailer.js` and add your smtp credentials (host, user, password)

Now the Clock of Change API server is ready to tick.

## Usage

**START THE SERVER**

In the base Clock-of-Change-API directory run

`npm run start`

in the console to start the Clock of Change API server.
This will start Nodemon and the Node.js server, which will start listening for and processing requests on `default port 1337`.

**MAKE REQUESTS**

Pro Tip: If you don't already have it: Get [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)! This amazing makes working with APIs a bliss ‚ù§

When using the default port 1337 (which you do if you haven't changed it in server.js), you can send requests to the Clock of Change API to `http://127.0.0.1:1337`.

**ROUTES**

List of routes / endpoints

**AUTHENTICATION**

to authenticate simply send API-Key in each requests headers

**USAGE:**

if you have nodemon installed from dev dependencies use "npm start" 
to run the Server, the default port is 1337.

to ensure emails are working properly make sure to set your smtp credentials in 
/core/mailer.js this will use templates from /mails directory.

once the server is running you can use the following routes:

GET http://127.0.0.1/cube.php
   - return the current count of entries with email_confirmed === 1 && status === 1
   - no auth required
   - returns the number (we change to json once we can adjust hardware clocks)
GET http://127.0.0.1/entries/verify/:k
   - verify an entry with a valid link parameter :k for example http://127.0.0.1/entries/verify/sadSdjsarj3jf3j3wfmwfj3w
   - no auth required
   - returns {success : true || false, invalidKeyError if key is invalid/used}
POST http://127.0.0.1/entries
   - call with body data firstname, lastname, email, country, message, anon (int 0 or 1), image to create a new entry
   - requires auth (see **AUTHENTICATION**)
   - returns {success : true}
   - may return errors mimeError, sizeError, missingFields, fieldErrors, missingImageError
   
GET http://127.0.0.1/entries 
    - to get back all entries allowed parameters are limit (10), offset (0) and active (false)
    where active will return items which have email_confirmed === 1 AND status === 1
    - requires auth
    - returns {success : true, results : out, totalCount : results.length, page : offset}
    - return {success : false, message : "error"}
